## Virtualization

Virtualization removes the need for physical hardware to install and run an OS.  
You can install any OS on top of any other OS thanks to something called a hypervisor.  

A hypervisor is a technology that allows hosting multiple virtual computers on a physical computer.  
It uses physical resources (CPU, RAM, storage, I/O devices) to create virtual machines (VMs).  

VMs, even if running on the same host system, don't see each other, they're completely isolated.  

### Type 2 Hypervisor

This type of hypervisor is installed on top of an OS already running on a physical machine.   
One of the most popular Type 2 hypervisors is VirtualBox.

## Linux File System vs Windows'

Linux File System has a hierarchical tree structure.  
We have one root folder which contains all other folders and files.  

In comparison, the Windows file system does not have one root folder where all the folders stem from.  
It rather has multiple root folders.  
When PCs only had insertable floppy disks, Windows used letters to assign drives for each insertable disk slot.  
Which is why A and B were used for removable disks, and they used C: when internl hard drives appeared.
