## Virtualization

Virtualization removes the need for physical hardware to install and run an OS.  


## Linux File System vs Windows'

Linux File System has a hierarchical tree structure.  
We have one root folder which contains all other folders and files.  

In comparison, the Windows file system does not have one root folder where all the folders stem from.  
It rather has multiple root folders.  
When PCs only had insertable floppy disks, Windows used letters to assign drives for each insertable disk slot.  
Which is why A and B were used for removable disks, and they used C: when internl hard drives appeared.
